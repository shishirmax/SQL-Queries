Different types of measures in data warehousing
1. Additive : Additive measures can be summed across any of the dimensions associated with the fact table. Example: summation of Sales for a month or year.
2. Semi-additive : Measures can be summed across some dimensions, but not all; balance amounts are common semi-additive facts because they are additive across all dimensions except time
3. Non-additive : These are those specific class of fact measures which cannot be aggregated across all/any dimension and their hierarchy. Example: Facts which have percentages, ratios calculated.
